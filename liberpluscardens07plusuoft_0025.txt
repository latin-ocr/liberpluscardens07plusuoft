Master Maurice of Buchanan‚ relation of the said Constable,

“The relationship between Sir John Stewart of Derneley
and Maurice of Buchanan was this. Sir John Stewart had
married Elizabeth, second daughter of Dunean‚ Earl of Lennox,
whose eldest daughter Isabella married Murdoc, Duke of Al-

lander of LennOX, and thus combines in his person all the con-
ditions indicated by the work itself.

MSS. In narrating the battle of Bauge‚ fought in 1421, when
