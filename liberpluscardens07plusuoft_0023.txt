mini-Aen. xix

from Bale and written into the Bodleian MS. by FairfaX, and the
parenthetical assertion of Fairfax that Bishop Elphinstone was
the author, this compilation has always, until lately, been attri—
buted to Bishop Elphinstone of Aberdeen31 but our author tells
us in the Prologus that he knew Joan of Arc, who died in 1430,
”while Bishop Elphinstone was not born till the year 143 7.

Not long ago, however, Mr. W. F. Skene, in a paper read be-
fore 1116 Society of Antiquaries at Edinburgh‚2 brought forward
a theory which seems very satisfactorily to meet all the difficulss
ties of the question. His argument is briefly as follows :—-

“ In endeavouring to ascertain who the anonymous author of
this unpublished history really was, we have, first, to put
together all the indications afforded by the work itself ; and,
secondly‚ to examine whether the same marks apply to the
history of any 8601 who was in F rance at the period above
indicated. ⁶

“ The indications afforded by the Mss. are as follows :—

“ I. The author was 111 France during the period when the
Maid of Orleans played her part, knew her personally‚ and was
present at her death in 1430.

“ II. He was also in France during the life of the Princess
Margaret of Scotland after her marriage with the Dauphin, and
was in a position whieh brought him into dailyjntercourse
with her.3

¹ Stevenson, in his Preface already referred to, gives a letter from the MS.
Collection of the Correspondence of the Rev· Robert Wodrow, which now
belongs to the Advocates‘ Library in Edinburgh. It is addressed to Mr.
David Randy, Postmaster, Canongate, Edinburgh, and dated November 2,
1726. 'rhe following is an extract from it :—

“General Fairfax, when in Seotland‚ got the only copy 1 hear of in the
worlde of our Bishop Elphingstoun's us. History of Scotland, from Drum-
mond of Hauthornden; and when he returned to England he lodged it in
the Bodleyan Library.’'

This is no doubt our Bodleian MS.

² “ N otice of the probable author of the unpublished History of Scotland,
erroneously attributed to Bishop Elphinstone of Aberdeen. By william F.
Skene‚ Esq„ LL.D., F.S.A. Scot.'’ This paper is here quoted by Mr. Skene’s
kind permission.
