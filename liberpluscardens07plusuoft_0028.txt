tion of a word, possibly written out in full in the original, would
have been no guarantee that we have the author's very word
and to have given all the different contractions of the same
word in the five several MSS. would have added enormously
and unnecessarily to the bulk of the volume. In some cases
the transcribers themselves have evidently mistaken the con-
tractions of the original. Any erroneous or various readings
arising from this or any other cause will be noticed at the end of
a second volume. There has been the less hesitation in adopt-
ing this method of bald fidelity in editing this volume as it will
be followed ·by a Translation, with Notes, in a second volume,
in which an attempt will be made to exercise such discretion
and ingenuity as are usually expected of one who has under-
taken to edit a corrupt text.

It has been thought superfluous to print over again the first
five Books and the first fourteen chapters of Book VL, as they
have already been given, almost, verbatim, in Mr. Skene's
Fordun and Goodall's Bower. An Appendix to the Prefaoe,
however, contains the titles of the chapters of this omitted por-
tion of the Chronicle‚ and shows the passages interpolated or
altered by our Author.

In conclusion, the Editor wishes gratefully to acknowledge
how much he is indebted to his uncle, Mr. William F. Skene,
for invaluable advice and assistance. To Mr. Ginman he owes
some of the work connected with the earlier part of the volume,
and many most useful suggestions; and to M. J ules Petit of
the Royal Library of Brussels, a careful and intelligent collation
with the Brussels MS. He also wishes to thank the gentlemen
who placed the various MSS, at his disposal, and Mr. Bond of
the British Museum for the ready courtesy with which he
always allowed the Editor access to those MSS. which were

intrusted to his keeping.
FELIX SKENE.
