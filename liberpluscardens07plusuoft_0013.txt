PREFACE.

Tffls Chronicle has never hithelto been published as a'rhis ,
whole. It is founded mainly on Bower‘s Scotiehronicon3ffi¹ffi3fflss³e
yet, as it is in some passages a narrative at first-hand by the pub¹¹⁸h⁶²¹'
chronicler as an eye-witness of the events he describes, and is
moreover quoted as an authority by subsequent historians, it
no doubt deserves a place among the original works upon
which we mainly rer for the facts of Scottish history.

The eleventh Book was indeed printed for the Maitland Club
by Mr. Joseph Stevenson,¹ from the Fairfax MS. in the Bod-
leian Library, which he believed to be the only Latin text of
this Chronicle extant3 and his preface to that work will be
adveIted to hereafter.

The Chronicle opens with five books closely following the Plan qsthe
‘first five books of F ordun's Chronica Gentis Scotorum, as Chromcle.
given in Bower, Then follow fifteen chapters of Book VL,
somewhat abridged from Bower, Book VI. cap. 9 to 23 inclu-
sive, and nearly as compiled by Fordun‚² concluding with a
memorandum stating that the preceding part of the work was
due to Fordun‚ the subsequent part down to the time of
fiames 11. to Bower, and the remainder to one whose name

would appear at the end of that sixth book-⁹» This promise,
