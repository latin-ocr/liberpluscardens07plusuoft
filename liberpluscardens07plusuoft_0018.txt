(3.) Three Bulls of Pope Innocent, viz. :--—

“ Confirmacio confoederacionis inter regem Soociae et
Norowagiae,'' dated April 1487.

“ De exspectacione octo mensium in promocione pree·-
latorum et interdicti amocione,'’ etc„ dated May
14873 and

Indulgence granted to St. Andrews‚ same date.

(4.) Protest by Adam Formam prior of Dunfermline, and
the other monks of that Monastery, on behalf of Arch-
bishop J ames Beton of St. Andrews, Commendator
of the Monastery‚ against a sentence of excommuni-
cation for non-payment of a debt, dated 3d May
1525. It is probably to this document that Fairfax
refers in his above-quoted memorandum about the
book having belonged to Dunfermline Monastery.

5. MS. Marchmont, A. O. 15, is evidently a copy of the pre-
ceding MS„ and follows it in every particular. It contains,
however, prefixed to the text of the narrative, the “ Praefacio ''
and the “ Prologus '' (pp. 3, 4 of this edition), and a Table of
Contenta of the first book, which are not to be found in any of
the foregoing MSS„ and which were probably copied from a lost
leaf of the Bodleian MS. The Prologus states that the work
was compiled at the desire of the Abbot of Dunfermline.

This MS. has on the first page the words, “Lioin Albinic,''
and “ liber Ricardi Bruni et amicorum ;’' and then, “ Liber
Sancte marie de N eubotill ex dono virorum venerabilium
domini Henrici et domini J acob1 Herculi de Linlithqw! '² The
signature‚‘ ‘.J Gilmourss' appears at the very top, though it is
scored out and almost illegible?
