xvi PREFAOE.

(6.) Some Latin lines on Princess Margaret’s marriage
with James 1v. in 1503.

(7.) Rough draft of an account in Latin of how the monastery
of Scone obtained compensation for the crops having
been trodden down during the coronation of Robert 111.
(in same hand as No. 1).1

(8.) Beginning of a deed dated 1506, by some Abbot
John.

6. MS. Bibliotheque Royale‚ Brussels, No. 7396, also is a
copy of the Bodleian MS„ but contains the ‘¹ Praefacio'’ and

“ Prologus‚” and the latter part seems to be in the same hand—
writing as the Marchmont MS?

All these MSS. but the Oavers, which is a folio, are quartos,

’ written on paper, the Glasgow MS. and its two copies across

the page, and the Bodleian and its two copies in double
columns.

It would thus seem, from such evidence as is furnished by
the MSS. themselves, that the Chronicle was compiled in 1461

-for Richard Bothuele‚ then Abbot of Dunfermline.

The original MS. seems to be no longer extant, but is repre-
sented by two principa] MSS„ both probably immediate tran-
scripts of it: (1.) the Glasgow MS„ a faithful copy written
probably by a Frenchman, between 147 8 and 1496, for William
Schevez‚ Archbishop of St. Andrews, passing about the middle

joie’s verses in the Marchmont MS. are some “ Metra magni Thurci a papa
Alexandro? Moreover the passage “ et les aureilles de plusieurs auditeurs,’'
at the beginning of the Pmlogue, is Domat’s translation os “ et multorum
aures audieneium‚” as the passage stands in this Ms., and not of ‘⁸ et mul-
centur aures audiencium‚'’ as it is given in the Brussels Ms.

From these slender indications we may perhaps surmise that this MS.
passed into the possession of Montjoie, the French Roi ffArmes, and was
the very text from which Do'mat made his translation in 1519. The words
“Licin Albinic‚’' which it is difficult to account for, may be in some way
connected with this episode in the history of the Ms.

The promised history of J oan of Arc and the author's name are wanting
in Domat’s translation, as in all the Latin mss.
