PREFACE. XV

In the same hand as the text are copied at the end a Table
of Contents‚ the Appeal of the Paris University above men-
tioned, and a List of Monasteries‚¹ the missing original of
which in the Bodleian MS. was replaced from the “ originall
autographe of the Bibliothek of the College of Edinburgh ; '’
and there are besides, on the several fly-leaves, in various hands,
the following :—

(1.) The signature “ Cauford,’' and colophon in same
hand, stating that this work was almost entirely “con-
forme magno Scotichronico quod aliquando suit D.
Andreae SceneZ, Archiepiscopi S. Andreae, nisi quod
ibi fusius hic per compendium aliquoties narratur,’'
etc. ⁹

(2.) Some scraps of Latin verse.

(3.) “ Heir followis the causis and occasiouns of the con-
uencioun of the nobill men that conuenit in Linlitth,
the xxii day of J ulii anno etc. xliii⁰,’' etc„ and part of
contract of marriage between Queen Mary and Prince
Edward of England, also about that date.

(4.) A religious “ Ballat ’' by J ohne Ballenden‚ “ imprentit
be J ohne Scot.''

(5.) Some Latin scraps by the French Roi d'Armes Mont-
joie, signed “ Vre bon amy Montjoie R.’'2

² Stevenson, in his Preface to his edition of the Eleventh Book above rc-
ferred to, gives a description of a MS. in the Library of Ste. Genevieve in
Paris, supplied to him by M. Francisque Michel. It is a “chronique
d’Escosse‚ traduite du Latin, et dedice a Jehan duc d'Albanie, comte de
Boulogne et d’Auvergne, de la Marche, et Regent d'Escosse, etc., par Bre-
mond Domat, commencee le 18 J uin 1519.’‘

This is evidently a translation of our Chronicle, and contains the Preface
and Prologue prefixed to the Marchmont and Brussels Mss. 3 as these, how-
ever, are wanting in the Bodleian MS„ which was the only Latin text
Stevensonf knew of, he failed to see the connection between it and Domat's
translation, and says, “ The original Latin from which Domat translated is,
as far as the editor is awai-e, unknown, and its recovery would add in no
inconsiderable degree to the historical materiale as well of France as of
Scotland ’'

Now, on the fly-leaf of Domat's work are some French verses signed by
him, among which occurs this line, in praise of Scotland : ‘⁶ Et contre Tureqs
