however, is nowhere fulfilled.1 Then come the rest of Book VI.
and five more books, being an abridgment of the rest of the
Scotichronicon, though at variance with it on some points, and
introducing much original matter. The narrative closes with ‚
-the death of J ames 1., as in the Scotichronicon.
Μαρια· The text has come down to us in six manuscripts, a detailed
scnpts. notice of which is here given.

1. MS. Glasgow College, F. 6. 14.—-This MS. is written in
two different hands, and contains merely the text of the Chro-
nicle. At the top of the first page is written “ Scheuez ;'' at
the foo't, “ Liber Willelmi Gaderar, anno 154- ;’' and the first
few rubrical letters, originally left blank, are filled 'm by
Gaderar, whose signature also appears at the end.2 The MS.
closes with the French words “ G’est tout,'' and the following
colophon, in the same hand as the text :-——

“ Iste liber scriptus fuit apud Dunfermlin,Willelmo Sancti Andreae
‘'ArchiepiscopQ de mandato domini Thomae Monymelle monachi et

sacristae ejusdem loci.'' =

William Schevez was Archbishop of St. Andrews from 147 8
to 14963 so that the Ms. was probably written at some time
within that period. In Book VIII. cap. xvii„ however, this MS, .
in mentioning the league between Charlemagne and Achaius,
King of the Scots, adds, “ et usque in hunc diem hujus opus-
culi scripturae, viz, anno Domini M.cccc.lxi, inviolata et incon--
cussa manet conservata ;'’ thus fixing the date of the compila-
tion of the work as early as 1461. That it could not have
been compiled earlier than 1460 is proved by a passage in
Book XI. cap. v., which mentions the death of J ames 11. in
1460.

The opinion that this MS. is not an original, but a transcript,
made between the· years 1478 and 1496, of an original com-

1 In the Glasgow MS. the half of the leaf which might have contained the
‘author-'s name is torn out at the end of Book vr.

2 The name of Will. Gaderar, a bailie of Elgin, appears on a deed of 1529

-Reyistrum Moram'enae, p. 416 ; and will. Gaderar, a burgess of Elgin, wit-
nesses a chartei· in 1569, ibid. p. 403.
