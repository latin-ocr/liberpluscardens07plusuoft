3. MS. Cavers also is a copy of the Glasgow MS., containing
the colophon, the words “ C’est tout‚” and “ W. Gaderar ;” and
adding, “ Ex autographo transcriptus hic liber, 2⁶⁰ Febru 1696.”

4. MS. Bodleian, Fairfax 8.—This MS. contains in the main
the same text 33 1113 three preceding MSS, but with such altera-
tions and corrections as give it the character of a revised ver-

“sion‚ its statements being made to cor-respond with the year
1489, the date at which it was transcribed. This date appears
in the above-quoted passage from Book vm. cap. xvii„ where it
is substituted for the year 1461. In Book x. cap. viii„ for in-
stance, the text of 1461, represented hythe Glasgow MS„ speaks

-of William Earl of Orkney as “ adhuc superstitem ;'’ whereas
in this later version these words are omitted, William having
died in the meantime.¹

The MS„ moreover, contains the long passage referred to as

'having been omitted in the Glasgow MS. and its two copies, as
well as the two chapters os Book xl. in the Scottish dialect3
and from many indicatione which need not here be· specified
(though they may for the most part be gathered from the foot-
notes to this edition), it would appear to have been transcribed
with alterations from the same original as the Glasgow MS.

On the first page of the MS. are the following memoranda in
the handwriting of Fairfax :—

“ Author hujus libri mihi (ad praesens) non constat—Scripsit et
11οο Chronicon eddidit 1489. v. 1110, libro 8, cap. 17.'’

Then, apparently added later, a notice of “ Bp Elphanston,”
from Bale, Centuria Quinta3 then, “ He was sent over with
Margaret the King’s daughter married to the Dolphin of
France, and continued with her till her death. Quod vidi post,

¹ Wood’s Peeraye of Scotland, voL ii. p. 339, speaking of this Earl's 133113,
says, ‘¹ Sir Oliver Sinclair, upon whom 1113 father settled all his estates south
of the Tay, of which he had a oharter 101311 December 1476. But after 1113
father's death, his eldest brother, William Sinclair of Newburgh, raised a
reduction ot* that settlement. A compi-omisa was entered into . . . 91311
February 1481-2.’-’ So that this Earl was alive in 1476, but dead before
1482.
