XX PREFACE.

“ ΙΙΙ. Η8 was a Scotsman‚ for he translated a Latin poem on
the death of the Dauphiness into Scots, at the command of her
brother J ames 11. of Scotland.¹

“ IV. He was probably a cleric, because he tells us, in the
prologue, that he compiled his work at the command of the
Abbot of Dunfermline.

“ V. And he was also probably a Highlander, for he usually

f'gives Highland names in their Gaelic form. Thus, when
Bower mentions the 01811 Κ81811, 1118 81111101, 111 1118 00118-
sponding passage, substitutes the Gaelic form of 01811 Gille-
chatan.²

“ Now, on turning to the Scots who were in France at this
time, we find that, in 1420, the States of Scotland sent a body
of 7 000 men 10 1118 assistance of the French in their struggle
with the English, under the command of John Earl of Buchan,
Archibald Earl of Wigton, and Sir John Stewart of Derneley,
who was made constable of the Scotch army in France. In
1425, according to Bower‚ Sir John Stewart was sent, along with
the Archbishop of Rheims, on an embassy 10 8001181111, to obtain
further assistance, and 10 negotiate a marriage between the
Dauphin of France and the Princess Margaret of Scotland3
and, in 1428, we find him in the town of Orleans, assisting
with his Scotch troops in the defence of that town against the
English, who besieged it. On the 10111 February in that year,
he was slain in a sortie from the town, and was buried in the
Lady Chapel of the Cathedral of Orleans,

“ Now, in the French accounts of J ean Mauleon, receiver-
general of 181188, there appears, in 1427, 8 grant to Sir John
Stewart of a sum of money for the expense of his embassy to
Scotland. It is as follows :—‘ Par mandement, du 24 Octobre
a Messire J ehan Stuart, Connetable des Escoszays pour lui
aider 8 faire son veaige en Escoce et pour autre causes, cinq cent
livres! And this is followed by an entry, ‘ A Maitre Morice
