The Marchmont MS„ as the most easy of access, has been
chosen as the text, and collated with the other MSS„ except
the Cavers, which was thought too recent to be of much
interest.

Effin‘i’gltehe Though no title is given to this work in any of the MSS„ yet
” George Buchanan, in the tenth book of his Rerum Scoticarum
Historia, refers on two occasions so unmistakably to this book
‘as the biber Musam-demis, that this has been unhesitatingly
adopted as the title.² ²
Authorship The question of the authorship of this Chronicle is involved
‘effigiale in much obscurity. The author's name is not given at the end
of the sixth book, as promised, nor does it appear anywhere else
throughout the work 3⁸ and George Buchanan himself seemed
not to know it, as he speaks only of “ him who wrote the Book
of Pluscarden‚”⁴ without naming him.

owing probably to the notice of “Bp.E1phanst0n '’ extracted

institution in Mnxxxu. By George Brunton and David Haig.

³ There seems indeed to have been, for some reason now impossible to
“guesffi an intention to suppress any clew to the author; for the name of the
Abbot of Dunfermline, at whose command the work was compiled, as stated
in the Prologus, is left blank in both the MSS. where the Prologus is given,
as if it had been erased in the original ; and it 10 also worthy of note that
the account of the Maid of Orleans‚ which the author, as an eyewitness,
”promises in the Prologus, stops short in all the MSS. after the second sentence,
and a blank is left. (See p. 367, Book x. .c. 32.)
