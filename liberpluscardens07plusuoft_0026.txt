xxii PREFACE.

the English were defeated and their leader the Duke of Glar-
ence slain, Bower states that the Duke was killed by the Earl
of Buchan. The author of this work, however, in his account,
says, that ‘ in such a general conflict it was difficult to ascertain
with certainty by whom each person was slain, but the public
gossip was, that a Scottish Highlander, Alexander Macauslan
from LennOX, a cadet of the family of the Lairds of Buchanan‚
slew the Duke of Clarence, in proof of which, the gdlden
coronet, adorned 'with precious stones, which the Duke carried
on his helmet, was brought from the field of battle by the said
Macauslan, who sold it to Sir John Stewart of Demeley for
1000 nobles, by whom it was afterwards pledged to Robert of
Houston for a sum of 5000 nobles, which he owed! Now

Dunfermline to the Prior of Pluscarden, in which it is called
‘a cell of Dunfermline‚' and ‘a convent now of the order of
St. Benediet ς’ and 1456, another commission by the Abbot of
Dunfermline to William de Boyis, his sacristam, to visit the
Priory of Pluscardyn, with a view to its reformation,—a com-.
mission which ended in the usual way, for in 1460 we find the
Abbot confirming a deed granted by William de Boyis‚ Prior of
the Priory of Pluscarden.
